# project-euler
Project Euler was started by Colin Hughes (a.k.a. euler) in October 2001 as a sub-section on mathschallenge.net, now it is hosted on https://projecteuler.net

I have made all the solutions generalized so that they can be used to solve the problem for any viable range of input.

### #1-5
These problems have been solved in Java.
